# Here I create a full text index

## Steps
1. Create a new database with a file for a full text index
2. Add a table with some text
3. Create a full text index catalog
4. Run Queries on the full text catalog

## Outcome

```USE MASTER
GO
CREATE DATABASE FullTextExample
GO 
ALTER DATABASE FullTextExample
ADD FILEGROUP FullTextCatalog
GO
--use the database
USE FullTextExample
GO
--create table
CREATE TABLE Test
(
    testID int identity (1,1) primary key, --primary key will be autogenerated
    TestText nvarchar (255)
)

--insert text into the table
go
Insert into Test(TestText)
Values('For test to be successful we must have a lot of text'),
('The test was not successful. sad face'),
('there is more than one test that can try a man'),
('Success is a relative term'),
('It is a rare man that is always successful'),
('The root of satisfaction is sad'),
('men want success')

INSERT INTO Test (TestText)
VALUES ('I see something blue'),
('I saw the something blue'),
('I have seen the blue bird'), 
('I have been seen by the universe')

INSERT INTO Test (TestText)
VALUES ('I go to work every day'),
('I went to work yesterday'),
('I was going to the ball when a werewolf crossed my path'),
('I would have gone to the club if Ricky Bobby was not there')

## 7. Detatch the database from the server. Show a picture of the object window with the database gone.

## 8. Re-Attach the database. Show a picture of the Object window with the database reattched

## 9. Explain briefly the following recovery modes: Simple, Full, Bulk Logged
### Simple
* Does not back anything on the log
* Only as good as the last backup
### Full
*	Saves everything, logs get gigantic, but can restore up to the moment
### Bulk Logged
*	Ignores bulk inputs
*	Makes the log a little less big

## 10. In addition, Download the files for the MetroAlt database. Unzip them and place them in the data file folder for the new instance of SQL server. Attach the files to the server

## 11.  Load the scripts for CommunityService and the other databases we will look at. Run them to create the databases.
